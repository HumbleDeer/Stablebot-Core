The goal is to make an any-size machine that's capable of high-speed printing as well as toolchanging. 

This is the first attempt at release - Some files may be not correct. Feel free to shoot me an issue. This export is of my Currently built large machine (622x622x1000) with some new improvements made for my small machine.

Review additional design discussion on [my blog](https://www.lukeslab.online/blog/tag/Stablebot)

Todo:
1) Assembly Instructions
2) Complete BOM (seriously, just buy a bunch of m3 and m5 screws)
3) Release Tools, for both Single and Multi Use
  a) Jubilee TC Head
4) TAMV Unit (pending Kickstarter)
5) Better LCD handling
6) Dedicated Electronics Box
7) Wire management for TC units - Single-tool will use improved wiring using cable chains - In development, will be used on single-tool units, and used for cabling to E3D Stepper Head
